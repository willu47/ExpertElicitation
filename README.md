h2. Use of R code

The R code is provided with no support and is unfortunately of a rather typical scientist standard i.e. poorly commented and inefficient.  It got the job done.

You are welcome to make use of the code as best you can, licensing notwithstanding.

I will update the code as time goes on, and intend to make it more general and applicable to datasets other than that provided in data.txt.

h2. Contents of the repository

The repository contains the following files:
